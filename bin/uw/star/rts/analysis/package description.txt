The analysis package provides utilities to analyze artifacts for RTS techniques. For example, after source code is extracted, some RTS techniques 
may require a particular graph representation of the program(CFG). Extracting raw source code is the responsibility of extraction package, generate graph
representation of the program is in analysis package. This separation helps to track the cost of analysis. We also separate artifacts come from the 
artifact repository (we call it raw artifacts) and artifacts generated by analysis or by traceability recovery. The main reason of this separation is that
raw artifacts are come for free (without any cost) , while others have to consider the analysis cost.
