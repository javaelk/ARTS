Software Test Selection is a research area aimed at selecting a
subset of test cases from exsiting test suite for regression testing. Many STS
techniques have been proposed and evaluated , yet industry adoption is low. One of the challenges for a
test enginner to apply STS technique is to determine which STS technique to use
for the specific goal, process and product of the organization. Our proposed STS framework helps test engineers explictly express
their test selection goals, systematically analyze software artifacts
available in the development process, and select a STS technique provides the
most benifits with lowest cost. This framework also helps the research
community access to published STS techniques and reproduce the experiments or
conduct new experiments.
